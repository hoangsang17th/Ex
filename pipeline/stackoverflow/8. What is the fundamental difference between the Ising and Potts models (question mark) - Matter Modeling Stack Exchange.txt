This is the original text:

What I understand is that the only difference between the Ising and Potts models is that Ising has two types of spins, and Potts has n types of spins.
However, I am wondering if the Hamiltonian (energy formula) is the same or different.
Are the Hamiltonianas the same or different?
What other differences do they have?
