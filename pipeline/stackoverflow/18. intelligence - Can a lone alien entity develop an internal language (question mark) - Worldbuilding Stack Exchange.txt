I'm imagining a hypothetical lone organism on a planet. Something like Avatar, the movie's Eywa. I am envisioning it as a massive organism covering the entire surface of the planet but biologically one single coherent entity. It was always the only living thing on the planet. Language, to what I understand is a means of communication, be it chemical signaling between two rather un-intelligent bacteria, sign language communication between chimpanzees or advanced vocalization in case of humans - there are always multiple entities involved. This raises few questions, what would the alien's intellect, whatever it would mean for it be like ? From what I have searched from the internet, having a language is not a compulsion for having rational thought, so if presence of other entities is a roadblock in having the urge to 'communicate' and thus develop a language, then communication can be entirely circumvented because there is only one organism here, so there could be rational thought. But even that would be a dubious scenario, would this 'internal language' be like human internal monologue ? There will also be important considerations involved here, being a lone entity will there be a concept of linguistic/ psychological 'I' and 'You' ? Will there be a concept of 'motive' ? What I'm asking it here and not elsewhere is because I'm more interested in investigating the evolution of linguistic artifacts in such a setting rather than psychological ones.
Edit -
What I mean by 'language' is any intermediate abstraction regime held inside an organism used to describe and 'make sense of' what the senses give as input tangibly.
The 'multiple' questions asked in the post are just to convey my line of thought. There is just one question - Is such an 'intermediate abstraction' somehow achievable in a lone entity ?
