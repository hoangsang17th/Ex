This is the original text:

I boiled one chicken breast in three litres of water with three medium-sized raw onions, two teaspoons of ginger powder, two teaspoons of dried garlic flakes, 10–15 whole black peppers, two table spoons of canola oil, and three teaspoons of salt.
After boiling for almost 35 minutes, the water is reduced to two litres. Then I added three coils of egg noodles and cooked until the noodles were soft.
I tried the noodle soup, and it tasted bland. It felt like this soup was missing a lot of things. I finished eating the noodles, but I still have the breast piece and almost one litre of soup.
What can I add more to improve the taste of this soup?
N.B. I am allergic to bell peppers or chili peppers.
