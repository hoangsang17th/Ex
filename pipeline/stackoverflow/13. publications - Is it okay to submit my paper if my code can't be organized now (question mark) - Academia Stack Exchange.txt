This is the original text:

Currently, I am working on a model that includes deep neural networks. I am not an expert in coding nor are my colleagues.
I had a hypothesis and it seems to be working. So, I may need to write a research paper and publish it. It takes much time to go through every step and understand in detail the code modules I am using. I somehow managed to join the patches without knowing the coding-related details of each patch. I am taking the patches from the existing GitHub models.
Whenever I see the codes of research papers, they are well-organized by a team of experts. But I am alone and have no team. The research is a part of my thesis. I have no clue about organizing the code.
I have two options:

not sharing the code with the journal
In this case, if the journal asks for the code, then there is no other choice for me and I need to select the second option.

posting the managed code on GitHub and then keeping the link in the research paper.
I am afraid that the readability and the organization of the code impact the decision of reviewers.


Which option should I select now?
