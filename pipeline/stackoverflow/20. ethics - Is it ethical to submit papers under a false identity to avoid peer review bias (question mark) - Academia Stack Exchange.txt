According to Huber, J., Inoua, S., Kerschbamer, R., König-Kersting, C., Palan, S., & Smith, V. L. (2022). Nobel and novice: Author prominence affects peer review (August 16, 2022):

We invite more than 3,300 researchers to review a paper jointly written by a prominent author – a Nobel laureate – and by a relatively unknown author – an early-career research associate -, varying whether reviewers see the prominent author’s name, an anonymized version of the paper, or the less well-known author’s name. We find strong evidence for the status bias: while only 23 percent recommend “reject” when the prominent researcher is the only author shown, 48 percent do so when the paper is anonymized, and 65 percent do so when the little-known author is the only author shown.

The same effect was also replicated in 2006 and 2017, so it's not just one paper making this claim.
Given such a significant bias, would it be ethical to submit one's papers under a false identity? I.e. if you're Maria Ivanova from Moscow State University you might be worried about bias against Russian scientists, so you submit your paper as John Smith from MIT instead to make sure it gets a fair review. Or you might be working for the University of Alabama and worried that your papers won't get reviewed fairly due to the low rankings of your institution, so you instead pretend you work for Cornell.
