This is the original text:

I'm doing some testing on a battery (MC002787). I've noticed that the voltage after a load takes a few minutes to go back to the open voltage (voltage without load for a long time). Can anyone explain why it takes so long for the voltage to stabilize?
The battery is in a battery holder soldered on a PCB with 2 wires connected to an electronic load (no circuit on the PCB/no other component assembled). The electronic load is an SDL1020X-E by Sigilent. The electronic load is controlled and monitored using NI-Visa and Python.
For the test, I simply apply a current load on the battery (100 mA) for 1 min or 10 min using the electronic load. The sample rate is 1 Hz (1 sample/second). I can see the voltage slowly go back to a stable value when there is no current load on the battery.
Side note: Is it possible to share an Excel file on Stack Exchange (to share the data collected during both tests)?
