This is the original text:

I am an Italian citizen currently studying in Germany. I have an Italian passport and an Italian ID. I would like to do an internship in the UK or in the US in the next year. When applying, I have to answer the following questions:

Are you entitled to work in this country?
Do you now or in the future need the help of the employer to obtain work authorization?

Unfortunately, I don't really know how this works and what I have to choose here.
