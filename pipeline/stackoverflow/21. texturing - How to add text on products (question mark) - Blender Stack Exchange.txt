This is the original text:

I want to add texts/labels to the product models I make. How do I do that? Using a Shrinkwrap modifier is one method but it is neither accurate nor satisfying. Another method is UV unwrapping but I don't know how to mix nodes to place texts exactly where I want without compromising the shader node underneath.
